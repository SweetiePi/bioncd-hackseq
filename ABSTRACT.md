# Abstract

Sequence alignment has long been the de-facto method for determing similarity between two genomes. Algorithms which implement sequence alignment are abundant and widely used; the paper describing BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm) has over 70,000 citations, making it one of the most frequently cited tools in biology. However, in cases of low sequence homology, horizontal gene transfer, or lack of apriori information, as is common when dealing with pathogenic bacteria, alignment-based methods pose significant problems. New methods are required to analyze this data, and I hope to introduce the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) as one such method.

NCD is a parameter-free metric which utilizes compression algorithms in order to estimate similarity. These algorithms find and take advantage of redundancies in a given input signal in order to reduce the size required to encode that signal. Intuition says that the more similar two strings are, the more redundancies they will have, which will result in a better compression score. NCD has been used in many different ways, such as [classifying musical genres of mp3 files](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/music.pdf), [scanning Android files for viruses](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11416-015-0260-0) and [natural language processing](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P10-2015). However, there are currently no existing tools which apply NCD towards biological datasets.
