# bioncd-hackseq
**BIO**logical implementation of the **N**ormalized **C**ompression **D**istance (name tentative to change). This repository was initated as a [hackseq18](https://www.hackseq.com) project titled "Alignment-free Pathogen Genomics", with development scheduled for October 12th - 14th, 2018.

# Initial Description
Sequence alignment has long been the predominant bionformatic method in determing similarity between two genomes. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is one of the most frequently cited scientific papers.

# hackseq18 goal
Our goal is to develop bioncd, a pipeline that takes sequences as input, and output a. This pipeline can be broken down into 3 

1) Compression
2) Clustering
3) Visualization

# Pre-requisities
This is a pure Python. 
If you are uncomfortable, don't fret! We 
Knowledge of compression algorithms/information theory is not required, but would be nice to know. 

# Dependencies
Update with dependencies here. Most likely we will require:
